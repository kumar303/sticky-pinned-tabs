This browser extension forces all links within a pinned tab to open with `target=_blank`. This makes your pinned tabs more "sticky" in that clicking on links won't lose the pinned content.

## Installation

Install it for Firefox from [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sticky-pinned-tabs/).

Go to `about:addons` to set preferences.

## Development

Make sure you have Firefox and NodeJS (8 or higher) installed. Start developing like this:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Release

Bump the version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, create a git tag, execute `npm run pkg`, and upload the new version to the Firefox Developer Hub.

## Icons

The icons for this extension are provided by [icons8](https://icons8.com/).
